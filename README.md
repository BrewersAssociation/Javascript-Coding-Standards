## Introduction
This document is based on [Clean Code Javascript](https://github.com/ryanmcdermott/clean-code-javascript) by Ryan McDermott, [Eloqeunt Javascript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/) by Marijn Haverbeke, and [Learning Javascript Design Patterns](https://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/index.html) by [Addy Osomani](https://addyosmani.com/)

This document will outline the best practices for organizing and styling JS documents for Brewers Association Projects, as well as other programming best practices.

## Write Clean Code
We try and share coding styles between JS, CSS, and PHP. 
> - [Use tabs over spaces for indents](http://lea.verou.me/2012/01/why-tabs-are-clearly-superior/)
> - 80 character wide columns
> - meaningful whitespace
> - comment your code

## Comments

### Only comment things that have business logic complexity.
Comments are an apology, not a requirement. Good code *mostly* documents itself. Don't comment when the code is self-explanatory, however introduce complex functions with a comment block. Use BA style comment blocks to break up code

**Bad:**
```javascript
function hashIt(data) {
  // The hash
  let hash = 0;

  // Length of string
  const length = data.length;

  // Loop through every character in data
  for (let i = 0; i < length; i++) {
    // Get character code.
    const char = data.charCodeAt(i);
    // Make the hash
    hash = ((hash << 5) - hash) + char;
    // Convert to 32-bit integer
    hash &= hash;
  }
}
```

**Good:**
```javascript

function hashIt(data) {
  let hash = 0;
  const length = data.length;

  for (let i = 0; i < length; i++) {
    const char = data.charCodeAt(i);
    hash = ((hash << 5) - hash) + char;

    // Convert to 32-bit integer
    hash &= hash;
  }
}

```


### Don't leave commented out code in your codebase
Version control exists for a reason. Leave old code in your history.

**Bad:**
```javascript
doStuff();
// doOtherStuff();
// doSomeMoreStuff();
// doSoMuchStuff();
```

**Good:**
```javascript
doStuff();
```


### Don't have journal comments
Remember, use version control! There's no need for dead code, commented code,
and especially journal comments. Use `git log` to get history!

**Bad:**
```javascript
/**
 * 2016-12-20: Removed monads, didn't understand them (RM)
 * 2016-10-01: Improved using special monads (JP)
 * 2016-02-03: Removed type-checking (LI)
 * 2015-03-14: Added combine with type-checking (JR)
 */
function combine(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

**Good:**
```javascript
function combine(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```


### Avoid positional markers
They usually just add noise. Let the functions and variable names along with the
proper indentation and formatting give the visual structure to your code. That said, use bookmarks to break up large JS files into manageable sections

**Bad:**
```javascript
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Scope Model Instantiation
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
$scope.model = {
  menu: 'foo',
  nav: 'bar'
};

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Action setup
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
const actions = function() {
  // ...
};
```

**Good:**
```javascript
$scope.model = {
  menu: 'foo',
  nav: 'bar'
};

const actions = function() {
  // ...
};
``` 
## Comment Styles

### Table of Contents
```
/*
* Name of File
*
* Short description of the file. Can be multiline
*
* TOC
* 1.0 Section Title
*  - 1.1 Subsection
* 2.0 Section Title
*/
```
### Bookmarks
Coda lets you skip to sections by using this bookmark style. Everything in the TOC should be bookmarked
```
////
//
//! 1.0 Section Title
//
////

```
Describe complex functions with title, description, params, and return type
### Function Descriptions
```
/**
 * functionName()
 *
 * @summary What does this complex functino do?
 *
 *
 * @param type paramName : brief description
 * @param type paramName : brief description
 * 
 * @return none, or variable/object
 */
```
### First Level, Block Comment
```
// Second Level Comments describing something below
//----------------------------------------------------
```
### Second Level Comment
```
//-- Nice one line break to describe something below --//
```
### Inline Comments
```
// This is an inline, or one-line comment. Note the space and capitalization
```

## Variables
### Use meaningful and pronounceable variable names

**Bad:**
```javascript
const yyyymmdstr = moment().format('YYYY/MM/DD');
```

**Good:**
```javascript
const currentDate = moment().format('YYYY/MM/DD');
```

### Avoid Mental Mapping
Explicit is better than implicit. Related directly to above, using meaningful variable names

**Bad:**
```javascript
const locations = ['Austin', 'New York', 'San Francisco'];
locations.forEach((l) => {
  doStuff();
  doSomeOtherStuff();
  // ...
  // ...
  // ...
  // Wait, what is `l` for again?
  dispatch(l);
});
```

**Good:**
```javascript
const locations = ['Austin', 'New York', 'San Francisco'];
locations.forEach((location) => {
  doStuff();
  doSomeOtherStuff();
  // ...
  // ...
  // ...
  dispatch(location);
});
```

### Don't add unneeded context
If your class/object name tells you something, don't repeat that in your
variable name.

**Bad:**
```javascript
const Car = {
  carMake: 'Honda',
  carModel: 'Accord',
  carColor: 'Blue'
};

function paintCar(car) {
  car.carColor = 'Red';
}
```

**Good:**
```javascript
const Car = {
  make: 'Honda',
  model: 'Accord',
  color: 'Blue'
};

function paintCar(car) {
  car.color = 'Red';
}
```

### Use default arguments instead of short circuiting or conditionals
Default arguments are often cleaner than short circuiting. Be aware that if you
use them, your function will only provide default values for `undefined`
arguments. Other "falsy" values such as `''`, `""`, `false`, `null`, `0`, and
`NaN`, will not be replaced by a default value.

**Bad:**
```javascript
function createMicrobrewery(name) {
  const breweryName = name || 'Hipster Brew Co.';
  // ...
}

```

**Good:**
```javascript
function createMicrobrewery(name = 'Hipster Brew Co.') {
  // ...
}
```
## **Formatting**

*From Ryan McDermott:*
Formatting is subjective. Like many rules herein, there is no hard and fast
rule that you must follow. The main point is DO NOT ARGUE over formatting.
There are [tons of tools](http://standardjs.com/rules.html) to automate this.
Use one! It's a waste of time and money for engineers to argue over formatting.

For things that don't fall under the purview of automatic formatting
(indentation, tabs vs. spaces, double vs. single quotes, etc.) look here
for some guidance.

*From Nate*
All that said, there are some formatting rules I'd like BA Developers to follow to ensure consistent code (and maybe we use an automation tool in the future.

### Code Structure
- Tabs over spaces
- Consistent Comment styles
- Indent code to maintain readability/hierarchy

### Use consistent capitalization
JavaScript is untyped, so capitalization tells you a lot about your variables,
functions, etc. These rules are subjective, so your team can choose whatever
they want. The point is, no matter what you all choose, just be consistent.

**Bad:**
```javascript
const DAYS_IN_WEEK = 7;
const daysInMonth = 30;

const songs = ['Back In Black', 'Stairway to Heaven', 'Hey Jude'];
const Artists = ['ACDC', 'Led Zeppelin', 'The Beatles'];

function eraseDatabase() {}
function restore_database() {}

class animal {}
class Alpaca {}
```

**Good:**
```javascript
const DAYS_IN_WEEK = 7;
const DAYS_IN_MONTH = 30;

const SONGS = ['Back In Black', 'Stairway to Heaven', 'Hey Jude'];
const ARTISTS = ['ACDC', 'Led Zeppelin', 'The Beatles'];

function eraseDatabase() {}
function restoreDatabase() {}

class Animal {}
class Alpaca {}
```


### Function callers and callees should be close
If a function calls another, keep those functions vertically close in the source
file. Ideally, keep the caller right above the callee. We tend to read code from
top-to-bottom, like a newspaper. Because of this, make your code read that way.

**Bad:**
```javascript
class PerformanceReview {
  constructor(employee) {
    this.employee = employee;
  }

  lookupPeers() {
    return db.lookup(this.employee, 'peers');
  }

  lookupManager() {
    return db.lookup(this.employee, 'manager');
  }

  getPeerReviews() {
    const peers = this.lookupPeers();
    // ...
  }

  perfReview() {
    this.getPeerReviews();
    this.getManagerReview();
    this.getSelfReview();
  }

  getManagerReview() {
    const manager = this.lookupManager();
  }

  getSelfReview() {
    // ...
  }
}

const review = new PerformanceReview(employee);
review.perfReview();
```

**Good:**
```javascript
class PerformanceReview {
  constructor(employee) {
    this.employee = employee;
  }

  perfReview() {
    this.getPeerReviews();
    this.getManagerReview();
    this.getSelfReview();
  }

  getPeerReviews() {
    const peers = this.lookupPeers();
    // ...
  }

  lookupPeers() {
    return db.lookup(this.employee, 'peers');
  }

  getManagerReview() {
    const manager = this.lookupManager();
  }

  lookupManager() {
    return db.lookup(this.employee, 'manager');
  }

  getSelfReview() {
    // ...
  }
}

const review = new PerformanceReview(employee);
review.perfReview();
```

## **Functions**

BA Web Sites are huge, and have been edited over time. Because of this the global scope has become polluted with variables sprinkled throughout the site.

As modern javascript developers, we are now refactoring our code with the following best practices in mind.

 1. If a function will only be used once, use an **Anonymous Function** (Function Expression)
 2. If a function is standalone, but could be used more than once, use a named function (**Declared Function)** *ex. most functions in plugins.js*
 3. For semi-complex functionality, but self contained on one page use **Self-Executing Anonymous Functions** to protect variables from conflicting with the global scope *ex. Events Pages, Page with a custom form*
 4. For complex functionality shared over many pages use the **[Revealing Module Pattern](https://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#revealingmodulepatternjavascript)** *ex. Join Now, Myrcene*

- [W3C's simple description of different function types](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_function_definition.asp)
- [Named function expressions demystified](http://kangax.github.io/nfe/)
- [Intro to Self-executing anonymous functions - Noah Stokes](http://esbueno.noahstokes.com/post/77292606977/self-executing-anonymous-functions-or-how-to-write), good lead-in to the Revealing Module Pattern

### Anonymous Functions (Expression Functions) vs Declared Functions

Realize when we name use Function Expressions, the function can not be called ABOVE the function definition.

**Declared Function**
If the function you are writing is simple, doesn't create or modify global variables, **and will be used more than once**, use Declarative Functions.

```javascript
getPerson() // works
function getPerson() {
	// do something
	
	return person;
}
getPerson(); // works
```

**Good (Anonymous Function, or Function Expression):**
If a function is going to be used **only one time**, use as Anonymous Function

Note expression is closed with a semicolon.

This style of function also very useful when creating deferred functions (Promises), as we don't need to nest the callbacks.

This style of function is part of the Revealing Module Pattern.
```javascript
getPerson(); // doesn't work
let getPerson = function() {
	// do something asyncronously
	.
	.
	.
	deferred.resolve(contact);
	
	//This function returns a deferred object
	var deferred = $.Deferred();
	return deferred.promise();	
};

getPerson(); // works

getPerson.done( function(person){

});
```

**Also Good (Self Executing Function Expression):**
Note expression is closed with ```();```. All variables are protected and won't conflict with the global scope. The Revealing Module Pattern is one huge Self Executing Function Expression. (Out of scope for this document, but [learn more here](https://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#revealingmodulepatternjavascript))

```javascript
// thousand line of codes
// written a year ago

// now you want to add some peice of code
// and you don't know what you have done in the past
// just put the new code in the self executing function
// and don't worry about your variable names

(function () {
    var i = 'I';
    var can = 'CAN';
    var define = 'DEFINE';
    var variables = 'VARIABLES';
    var without = 'WITHOUT';
    var worries = 'WORRIES';

    var statement = [i, can, define, variables, without, worries];

    alert(statement.join(' '));
    // I CAN DEFINE VARIABLES WITHOUT WORRIES
}());
```
### Function arguments (2 or fewer ideally)
Limiting the amount of function parameters is incredibly important because it
makes testing your function easier. Having more than three leads to a
combinatorial explosion where you have to test tons of different cases with
each separate argument.

One or two arguments is the ideal case, and three should be avoided if possible.
Anything more than that should be consolidated. Usually, if you have
more than two arguments then your function is trying to do too much. In cases
where it's not, most of the time a higher-level object will suffice as an
argument.

Since JavaScript allows you to make objects on the fly, without a lot of class
boilerplate, you can use an object if you are finding yourself needing a
lot of arguments.

To make it obvious what properties the function expects, you can use the ES2015/ES6
destructuring syntax. This has a few advantages:

1. When someone looks at the function signature, it's immediately clear what
properties are being used.
2. Destructuring also clones the specified primitive values of the argument
object passed into the function. This can help prevent side effects. Note:
objects and arrays that are destructured from the argument object are NOT
cloned.
3. Linters can warn you about unused properties, which would be impossible
without destructuring.

**Bad:**
```javascript
function createMenu(title, body, buttonText, cancellable) {
  // ...
}
```

**Good:**
```javascript
function createMenu({ title, body, buttonText, cancellable }) {
  // ...
}

createMenu({
  title: 'Foo',
  body: 'Bar',
  buttonText: 'Baz',
  cancellable: true
});
```

### Functions should do one thing
This is by far the most important rule in software engineering. When functions
do more than one thing, they are harder to compose, test, and reason about.
When you can isolate a function to just one action, they can be refactored
easily and your code will read much cleaner. If you take nothing else away from
this guide other than this, you'll be ahead of many developers.

**Bad:**
```javascript
function emailClients(clients) {
  clients.forEach((client) => {
    const clientRecord = database.lookup(client);
    if (clientRecord.isActive()) {
      email(client);
    }
  });
}
```

**Good:**
```javascript
function emailActiveClients(clients) {
  clients
    .filter(isActiveClient)
    .forEach(email);
}

function isActiveClient(client) {
  const clientRecord = database.lookup(client);
  return clientRecord.isActive();
}
```


### Function names should say what they do

**Bad:**
```javascript
function addToDate(date, month) {
  // ...
}

const date = new Date();

// It's hard to tell from the function name what is added
addToDate(date, 1);
```

**Good:**
```javascript
function addMonthToDate(month, date) {
  // ...
}

const date = new Date();
addMonthToDate(1, date);
```
### Set default objects with Object.assign
*@TODO Discuss. We don't do this with Join Now, but should*
**Bad:**
```javascript
const menuConfig = {
  title: null,
  body: 'Bar',
  buttonText: null,
  cancellable: true
};

function createMenu(config) {
  config.title = config.title || 'Foo';
  config.body = config.body || 'Bar';
  config.buttonText = config.buttonText || 'Baz';
  config.cancellable = config.cancellable !== undefined ? config.cancellable : true;
}

createMenu(menuConfig);
```

**Good:**
```javascript
const menuConfig = {
  title: 'Order',
  // User did not include 'body' key
  buttonText: 'Send',
  cancellable: true
};

function createMenu(config) {
  config = Object.assign({
    title: 'Foo',
    body: 'Bar',
    buttonText: 'Baz',
    cancellable: true
  }, config);

  // config now equals: {title: "Order", body: "Bar", buttonText: "Send", cancellable: true}
  // ...
}

createMenu(menuConfig);
```

### Don't use flags as function parameters
Flags tell your user that this function does more than one thing. Functions should do one thing. Split out your functions if they are following different code paths based on a boolean.

**Bad:**
```javascript
function createFile(name, temp) {
  if (temp) {
    fs.create(`./temp/${name}`);
  } else {
    fs.create(name);
  }
}
```

**Good:**
```javascript
function createFile(name) {
  fs.create(name);
}

function createTempFile(name) {
  createFile(`./temp/${name}`);
}
```
### Avoid Side Effects (part 2)
In JavaScript, primitives are passed by value and objects/arrays are passed by
reference. In the case of objects and arrays, if your function makes a change
in a shopping cart array, for example, by adding an item to purchase,
then any other function that uses that `cart` array will be affected by this
addition. That may be great, however it can be bad too. Let's imagine a bad
situation:

The user clicks the "Purchase", button which calls a `purchase` function that
spawns a network request and sends the `cart` array to the server. Because
of a bad network connection, the `purchase` function has to keep retrying the
request. Now, what if in the meantime the user accidentally clicks "Add to Cart"
button on an item they don't actually want before the network request begins?
If that happens and the network request begins, then that purchase function
will send the accidentally added item because it has a reference to a shopping
cart array that the `addItemToCart` function modified by adding an unwanted
item.

A great solution would be for the `addItemToCart` to always clone the `cart`,
edit it, and return the clone. This ensures that no other functions that are
holding onto a reference of the shopping cart will be affected by any changes.

Two caveats to mention to this approach:
  1. There might be cases where you actually want to modify the input object,
but when you adopt this programming practice you will find that those cases
are pretty rare. Most things can be refactored to have no side effects!

  2. Cloning big objects can be very expensive in terms of performance. Luckily,
this isn't a big issue in practice because there are
[great libraries](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/) that allow
this kind of programming approach to be fast and not as memory intensive as
it would be for you to manually clone objects and arrays.

**Bad:**
```javascript
const addItemToCart = (cart, item) => {
  cart.push({ item, date: Date.now() });
};
```

**Good:**
```javascript
const addItemToCart = (cart, item) => {
  return [...cart, { item, date: Date.now() }];
};
```
### Encapsulate conditionals

**Bad:**
```javascript
if (fsm.state === 'fetching' && isEmpty(listNode)) {
  // ...
}
```

**Good:**
```javascript
function shouldShowSpinner(fsm, listNode) {
  return fsm.state === 'fetching' && isEmpty(listNode);
}

if (shouldShowSpinner(fsmInstance, listNodeInstance)) {
  // ...
}
```
**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Avoid negative conditionals

**Bad:**
```javascript
function isDOMNodeNotPresent(node) {
  // ...
}

if (!isDOMNodeNotPresent(node)) {
  // ...
}
```

**Good:**
```javascript
function isDOMNodePresent(node) {
  // ...
}

if (isDOMNodePresent(node)) {
  // ...
}
```
### Avoid conditionals
This seems like an impossible task. Upon first hearing this, most people say,
"how am I supposed to do anything without an `if` statement?" The answer is that
you can use polymorphism to achieve the same task in many cases. The second
question is usually, "well that's great but why would I want to do that?" The
answer is a previous clean code concept we learned: a function should only do
one thing. When you have classes and functions that have `if` statements, you
are telling your user that your function does more than one thing. Remember,
just do one thing.

**Bad:**
```javascript
class Airplane {
  // ...
  getCruisingAltitude() {
    switch (this.type) {
      case '777':
        return this.getMaxAltitude() - this.getPassengerCount();
      case 'Air Force One':
        return this.getMaxAltitude();
      case 'Cessna':
        return this.getMaxAltitude() - this.getFuelExpenditure();
    }
  }
}
```

**Good:**
```javascript
class Airplane {
  // ...
}

class Boeing777 extends Airplane {
  // ...
  getCruisingAltitude() {
    return this.getMaxAltitude() - this.getPassengerCount();
  }
}

class AirForceOne extends Airplane {
  // ...
  getCruisingAltitude() {
    return this.getMaxAltitude();
  }
}

class Cessna extends Airplane {
  // ...
  getCruisingAltitude() {
    return this.getMaxAltitude() - this.getFuelExpenditure();
  }
}
```
## **Objects and Data Structures**
### Use getters and setters
*@TODO Discuss: This is really important in Join Now, and NZ isn't sure we're doing it properly*
Using getters and setters to access data on objects could be better than simply
looking for a property on an object. "Why?" you might ask. Well, here's an
unorganized list of reasons why:

* When you want to do more beyond getting an object property, you don't have
to look up and change every accessor in your codebase.
* Makes adding validation simple when doing a `set`.
* Encapsulates the internal representation.
* Easy to add logging and error handling when getting and setting.
* You can lazy load your object's properties, let's say getting it from a
server.


**Bad:**
```javascript
function makeBankAccount() {
  // ...

  return {
    balance: 0,
    // ...
  };
}

const account = makeBankAccount();
account.balance = 100;
```

**Good:**
```javascript
function makeBankAccount() {
  // this one is private
  let balance = 0;

  // a "getter", made public via the returned object below
  function getBalance() {
    return balance;
  }

  // a "setter", made public via the returned object below
  function setBalance(amount) {
    // ... validate before updating the balance
    balance = amount;
  }

  return {
    // ...
    getBalance,
    setBalance,
  };
}

const account = makeBankAccount();
account.setBalance(100);
```
## Classes (ES6)
BA hasn't delved into ES6/Classes (yet) but note that Ryan McDermott has a lot of good notes on this. In retrospect, BAJN could have been built with ES6.

## **Error Handling**
Thrown errors are a good thing! They mean the runtime has successfully
identified when something in your program has gone wrong and it's letting
you know by stopping function execution on the current stack, killing the
process (in Node), and notifying you in the console with a stack trace.

### Don't ignore caught errors
Doing nothing with a caught error doesn't give you the ability to ever fix
or react to said error. Logging the error to the console (`console.log`)
isn't much better as often times it can get lost in a sea of things printed
to the console. If you wrap any bit of code in a `try/catch` it means you
think an error may occur there and therefore you should have a plan,
or create a code path, for when it occurs.

**Bad:**
```javascript
try {
  functionThatMightThrow();
} catch (error) {
  console.log(error);
}
```

**Good:**
```javascript
try {
  functionThatMightThrow();
} catch (error) {
  // One option (more noisy than console.log):
  console.error(error);
  // Another option:
  notifyUserOfError(error);
  // Another option:
  reportErrorToService(error);
  // OR do all three!
}
```

### Don't ignore rejected promises
For the same reason you shouldn't ignore caught errors
from `try/catch`.

**Bad:**
```javascript
getdata()
  .then((data) => {
    functionThatMightThrow(data);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.log(error);
  });
```

**Good:**
```javascript
getdata()
  .then((data) => {
    functionThatMightThrow(data);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // One option (more noisy than console.log):
    console.error(error);
    // Another option:
    notifyUserOfError(error);
    // Another option:
    reportErrorToService(error);
    // OR do all three!
  });
```
